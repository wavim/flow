### Abandoned

Decided not to complete it, afterall. I asked myself if "ambiguity" would really
make a language terrible. Python is "ambiguous" by means of operator
overloading. Many major languages are "ambiguous" for having operators like
`+=`.

As Bjarne Stroustrup said, "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones
people complain about and the ones nobody uses."

Might be decent as an introductory language for people with absolutely no
experience with programming, but I deem even math paranoids nowadays could
understand `x = x + 1` with context, perhaps? The language is anything but
innovative or useful.

Pity, but I want to focus myself on other things I'm more interested in.
Frankly, (usual) languages are not one of them (but ones for alternative
computation models might). It cannot spark me joy. That's all.
